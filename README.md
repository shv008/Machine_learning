## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### ðŸ”¹ [1. Linear Regression ](https://github.com/shv008/Machine_learning/tree/main/Linear%20regression)
- Implemented simple linear regression from scratch using NumPy
- Visualized regression line and evaluated model performance
- RÂ² score and prediction plotting included

### ðŸ”¹ [2. Multiple Linear Regression ](https://github.com/shv008/Machine_learning/tree/main/multiple%20linear%20regression)
- Built using both:
  - âœ… From scratch using NumPy and matrix algebra
  - âœ… With scikit-learnâ€™s `LinearRegression`
- Evaluated with MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score
- Visualized Actual vs Predicted comparison

### ðŸ”¹ [3. Logistic Regression â€“ Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/shv008/Machine_learning/blob/main/classification/Logistic_regression_Diabetes_prediction.ipynb)
Built a binary classification model to predict whether a patient has diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

Implemented logistic regression using two approaches:
âœ… From scratch, using NumPy and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
âœ… Using scikit-learn, with built-in logistic regression functionality
